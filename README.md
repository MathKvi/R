# R
Final submission and approved task in R. Data scientist- EC Utbildning 2022
This is the submission of my work for final task in R programming. The 3 task are listed below. 
1. Basic algorithmic thinking in R.
 Get input temperature of 10 cities for a month from the user. Create 3 functions to compute the minimum, maximum and average temperature of each city in that month:
a) By using manual calculations
b) By using the in built functions in R

3. Data Pre Processing.
Download the chronic kidney disease dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease 
Pre process this data to fix proper formatting, corrupted data, missing data etc

5. Data Visualization.
Use R to input your data and visualize it with the help of at least 3 different plots. You may choose any library of your choice.
Edit the visual parameters of the data to make the information you want to express clearly visible. Your final visualization should have
variables clearly labelled and units equally proportioned. Ideas you might want to consider:
 Does my data have a spatial or geographic component?
 Does my data have a temporal component, showing change over time?
 How many variables am I trying to represent?
